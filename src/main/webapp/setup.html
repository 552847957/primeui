        <p>Getting Started with PrimeUI is a straightforward process.</p>

        <h3>Download</h3>
        <p>PrimeUI is distributed in a zip file that is available at <a href="http://www.primefaces.org/downloads.html#primeui">download page</a>.
            Once you download the file and extract it in filesystem, you'd see two folders named development and production. Development folder has
            the uncompressed and the Production folder has the compressed distribution.</p>

        <h3>Include Resources</h3>
        <p>Although you can include resources of each widget individually, it is suggested to use the prime-ui.js and prime-ui.css file to register all
            the widgets at once. As PrimeUI is jQuery UI based, you also need to include jQuery and jQuery UI.</p>

        <pre name="code" class="brush:xml">
                                &lt;head&gt;                                    
                                    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="%PATH%/theme.css" /&gt;
                                    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="%PATH%/jquery-ui.css" /&gt;
                                    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="%PATH%/prime-ui-min.css" /&gt;
                                    &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="%PATH%/jquery.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
                                    &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="%PATH%/jquery-ui.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
                                    &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="%PATH%/prime-ui.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
                                &lt;/head&gt;
        </pre>

        <p>Distribution also has a couple of images that are used by some of the widgets. The image folder should be placed at two level up for correct
            reference. For example if prime-ui.css is under %PATH%/resources/prime-ui/css/prime-ui-min.css location images folder should be at
            %PATH%/resources/images.</p>
